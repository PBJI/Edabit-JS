/*Destructuring Assignment (Ignoring Values)

You can assign variables from arrays like this:
_________
arr = [1, 2, 8]
first, , last = arr

first = lst[0]

last = lst[arr.length - 1]

console.log(first) ➞ outputs 1
console.log(last) ➞ outputs 8
_________

Using Destructuring Assignment (check the Resources tab), your task is to unpack the arrays writeyourcodehere into three variables, first, a variable to ignore all middle values and last.


[Notes]

_________
*) Your solution should be just One Line of code.
*) If your solution is longer than one line of code, please check the Resources tab.
