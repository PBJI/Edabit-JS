/*Front 3 - Slice Check Repeat Concatenate

Create a function that takes a string; we'll say that the front is the first three characters of the string. If the string length is less than three characters, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string, which is three copies of the front.


[Examples]

_________
frontThree("Python") ➞ "PytPytPyt"

frontThree("Cucumber") ➞ "CucCucCuc"

frontThree("bioshock") ➞ "biobiobio"
_________



[Notes]

Don't forget to return the result.
