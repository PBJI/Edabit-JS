/*Upvotes vs Downvotes

Given an object containing counts of both upvotes and downvotes, return what vote count should be displayed. This is calculated by subtracting the number of downvotes from upvotes.


[Examples]

_________
getVoteCount({ upvotes: 13, downvotes: 0 }) ➞ 13

getVoteCount({ upvotes: 2, downvotes: 33 }) ➞ -31

getVoteCount({ upvotes: 132, downvotes: 132 }) ➞ 0
_________



[Notes]

You can expect only positive integers for vote counts.
