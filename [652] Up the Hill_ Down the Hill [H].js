/*Up the Hill, Down the Hill

If a person traveled up a hill for 18mins at 20mph and then traveled back down the same path at 60mph then their average speed traveled was 30mph.
Write a function that returns the average speed traveled given an uphill time, uphill rate and a downhill rate. Uphill time is given in minutes. Return the rate as an integer (mph). No rounding is necessary.


[Examples]

_________
aveSpd(18, 20, 60) ➞ 30

aveSpd(30, 10, 30) ➞ 15

aveSpd(30, 8, 24) ➞ 12
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) The solution is not dividing the sum of the speeds by 2.
*) Check the Resources tab if your stuck.
