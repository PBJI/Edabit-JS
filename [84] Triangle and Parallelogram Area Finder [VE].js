/*Triangle and Parallelogram Area Finder

Write a function that accepts base (decimal), height (decimal) and shape ("triangle", "parallelogram") as input and calculates the area of that shape.


[Examples]

_________
areaShape(2, 3, "triangle") ➞ 3

areaShape(8, 6, "parallelogram") ➞ 48

areaShape(2.9, 1.3, "parallelogram") ➞ 3.77
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Area of a triangle is 0.5 * b * h
*) Area of a parallelogram is b * h
*) Assume triangle and parallelogram are the only inputs for shape.
