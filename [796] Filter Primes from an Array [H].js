####  Filter Primes from an Array  ####

Create a function that takes an array and returns a new array containing only prime numbers.


[Examples]

_________
filterPrimes([7, 9, 3, 9, 10, 11, 27]) ➞ [7, 3, 11]

filterPrimes([10007, 1009, 1007, 27, 147, 77, 1001, 70]) ➞ [10007, 1009]

filterPrimes([1009, 10, 10, 10, 3, 33, 9, 4, 1, 61, 63, 69, 1087, 1091, 1093, 1097]) ➞ [1009, 3, 61, 1087, 1091, 1093, 1097]

[Notes]

_________
*) New array must maintain the order of primes as they first appear in the original array.
*) Check the Resources tab for help.
