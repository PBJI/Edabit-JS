####  RegEx: Character Classes VIII ‚Å†- \d  ####

You can think of character classes as characters with special meaning. They are recognized as special when you place the \ before the character.
Here are a list of the characters classes in JavaScript:
_________
., \cX, \d, \D, \f, \n, \r, \s, \S, \t, \v, \w, \W, \0, \xhh, \uhhhh, \uhhhhh, [\b]
_________

Extract the addresses from this string:
_________
const str = "123 Redding Dr. 1560 Knoxville Ave. 3030 Norwalk Dr. 5 South St."

// ["123 Redding Dr.", "1560 Knoxville Ave.", "3030 Norwalk Dr.", "5 South St."]
_________

Write the regular expression that matches all street addresses. All street addresses begin with a number. Use the character class \d in your expression.
