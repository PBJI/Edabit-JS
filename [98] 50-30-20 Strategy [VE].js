/*50-30-20 Strategy

The 50-30-20 strategy is a simple way to budget, which involves spending 50% of after-tax income on needs, 30% after tax income on wants, and 20% after-tax income on savings or paying off debt.
Given the after-tax income as ati, what you are supposed to do is to make a function that will return an object that shows how much a person needs to spend on needs, wants, and savings.


[Examples]

_________
fiftyThirtyTwenty(10000) ➞ { "Needs": 5000, "Wants": 3000, "Savings": 2000 }

fiftyThirtyTwenty(50000) ➞ { "Needs": 25000, "Wants": 15000, "Savings": 10000 }

fiftyThirtyTwenty(13450) ➞ { "Needs": 6725, "Wants": 4035, "Savings": 2690 }
