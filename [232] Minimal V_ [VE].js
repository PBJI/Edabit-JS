/*Minimal V:

Check the principles of minimalist code in the intro to the first challenge.
In the Code tab you will find a code that has a missplaced character in order to pass the tests. However, your goal is to submit a function as minimalist as possible.
Write a function that returns the boolean true if the given arrays do not share any numbers, and false otherwise.
