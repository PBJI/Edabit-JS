/*Find Out the Leap Year

A leap year happens every four years, so it's a year that is perfectly divisible by four. However, if the year is a multiple of 100 (1800, 1900, etc), the year must be divisible by 400.
Write a function that determines if the year is a leap year or not.


[Examples]

_________
leapYear(2020) ➞ true

leapYear(2021) ➞ false

leapYear(1968) ➞ true
_________
