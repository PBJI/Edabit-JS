You will be given an array of drinks, with each drink being an object with two properties: name and price. Create a function that has the drinks array as an argument and return the drinks objects sorted by price in ascending order.

_________
drinks = [
  {name: "lemonade", price: 50},
  {name: "lime", price: 10}
]
_________

The output of the sorted drinks object will be:
