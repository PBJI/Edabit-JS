/*ES6: Destructuring Arrays I

You can assign variables from arrays like this:
_________
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
let a = arr[0]
let b = arr[1]

console.log(a) // outputs 1
console.log(b) // outputs 2
_________

With ES6, you can assign variables from arrays in a much more succinct way. Create variables a and b from the given array using the ES6 destructuring assignment syntax, where a === 1 and b === 2.
