/*Twitter Link Finder

Your job is to make a "Twitter link" regular expression rx. This RegEx searches a tweet to find the @handle and the #handle.

[Examples]

tweet("Visit us at @edabit") ➞ "@edabit"

tweet("Follow @JavaScript") ➞ "@JavaScript"

tweet("#Honesty is the best @policy!!") ➞ "#Honesty @policy"
_________



[Notes]

Make sure the RegEx doesn't return . , ! ?, etc.
