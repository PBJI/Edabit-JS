/*Many Operators!

Some basic arithmetic operators are +, -, *, /, and %. In this challenge you will be given three parameters, num1, num2, and an operator. Use the operator on number 1 and 2.


[Examples]

_________
operate(1, 2, "+") ➞ 3
// 1 + 2 = 3

operate(7, 10, "-") ➞ -3
// 7 - 10 = -3

operate(20, 10, "%") ➞ 0
// 20 % 10 = 0
_________



[Notes]

There will not be any divisions by zero.
