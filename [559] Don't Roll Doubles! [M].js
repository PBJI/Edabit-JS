/*Don't Roll Doubles!

John is playing a dice game. The rules are as follows.

But if you roll DOUBLES, your score is instantly wiped to 0 and your game ends immediately!
Create a function which takes in a matrix as input, and return John's score after his game has ended.


[Examples]

_________
diceGame([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) ➞ 21

diceGame([[1, 1], [5, 6], [6, 4]]) ➞ 0

diceGame([[4, 5], [4, 5], [4, 5]]) ➞ 27
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Ignore all other arrays in the matrix if a throw happens to be doubles and go straight to returning 0.
*) John only has two dice and will always give you outcomes for three rounds.
