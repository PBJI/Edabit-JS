/*Minimal VI: Ternary Operator

In the Code tab you will find code that is missing a single character in order to pass the tests. However, your goal is to submit a function as minimalist as possible. Use the tips in the tips section below.
Write a function that returns the strings:
_________
*) "both" if both given booleans a and b are true.
*) "first" if only a is true.
*) "second" if only b is true .
*) "neither" if both a and b are false.
_________



[Tips]

If-else statements can be written as a oneliner using Javascript's ternary operator.
For example, the code:
_________
function startswith(name) {
  if ("AEIOU".includes(name[0])) {
    return "vowel"
  } else {
    return "consonant"
  }
}
_________

Can be simplified to:
_________
function startswith(name) {
  return "AEIOU".includes(name[0]) ? "vowel" : "consonant"
}
_________



[Bonus]

You can concatenate as many ternary operators as you want. However, concatenating too many can diminish the readability of your code.
_________
x > 50 ? "majority" : x < 50 ? "minority" : "draw"
_________
