_________

Given a 2D array of watermelon where 0 is representing juicy watermelon while 1 is representing seed, return total number of seeds spit-out. See below example for detailed explanation :
Given a watermelon:
_________
1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1
1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0

0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

seeds = 0
total seeds = 0
_________

Mubashir eats 1/4 piece (4x4 matrix) of watermelon :
_________
x, x, x, x, 1, 1, 0, 1
x, x, x, x, 1, 1, 0, 0
x, x, x, x, 0, 0, 0, 0
x, x, x, x, 1, 1, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

seeds = 10
total seeds = 10 (All seeds were spit-out)
_________

Mubashir eats next 1/4 piece (4x4 matrix) of watermelon :
_________
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

seeds = 8
total seeds = 10+8 = 18 (All seeds were spit-out)
_________

Mubashir eats next 1/4 piece (4x4 matrix) of watermelon :
_________
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x

x, x, x, x, 0, 0, 1, 1
x, x, x, x, 0, 0, 0, 0
x, x, x, x, 0, 0, 0, 0

seeds = 7
total seeds = 18+7 = 25 (All seeds were spit-out)
_________

Mubashir eats last 1/4 piece (4x4 matrix) of watermelon :
_________
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x

x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x
x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x

seeds = 3
total seeds = 25+0 = 25
