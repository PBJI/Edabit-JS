/*Instances of the Fibonacci Sequence

Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns n instances of the Fibonacci sequence as an array.
Fibonacci numbers: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. So the easy explanation is: The next element is the sum of the two previous elements.
If you want to read more about this sequence, take a look at the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio. See the OEIS and Wikipedia links in the resources tab.


[Examples]

_________
fibSeq(4) ➞ [0, 1, 1, 2]

fibSeq(7) ➞ [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

fibSeq(0) ➞ []
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) If 0 is given, return an empty array.
*) If no argument is given, return undefined.
*) The input will never be a negative integer.
