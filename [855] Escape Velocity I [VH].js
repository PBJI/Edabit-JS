####  Escape Velocity I  ####

Escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a massive body, that is, to achieve an infinite distance from it. Escape velocity is a function of the mass of the body and distance to the center of mass of the body.


[Objective]

Create a function that takes a planet as an argument and returns its escape velocity expressed in m/s, km/h and km/s.


[Data]

In the following table you will find for each planet its mass relative to Earth and its radius relative to Earth:

Consider:
_________
*) Earth mass = 5.976e24 kg
*) Earth equatorial radius = 6378 km
*) Gravitational Constant G = 6.67e-11 N*m²/kg²
_________



[Examples]

_________
escapeVelocity("Earth") ➞ "The escape velocity in m/s is: 11179.98. The escape velocity in km/h is: 40247.93. The escape velocity in km/s is: 11.18."

escapeVelocity("Venus") ➞ "The escape velocity in m/s is: 10355.19. The escape velocity in km/h is: 37278.68. The escape velocity in km/s is: 10.36."

escapeVelocity("Mars") ➞ "The escape velocity in m/s is: 5013.92. The escape velocity in km/h is: 18050.11. The escape velocity in km/s is: 5.01."
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Round to the nearest hundred the escape velocity in m/s. Using the rounded escape velocity in m/s calculate the escape velocity in km/h and round that number to the nearest hundred. Finally, using the rounded escape velocity in m/s, calculate the escape velocity in km/s and round that number to the nearest hundred.
*) Pay special attention to units.
*) See part #2 of this series: Escape Velocity II.
