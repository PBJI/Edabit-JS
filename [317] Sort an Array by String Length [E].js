/*Sort an Array by String Length

Create a function that takes an array of strings and return an array, sorted from shortest to longest.


[Examples]

_________
sortByLength(["Google", "Apple", "Microsoft"])
➞ ["Apple", "Google", "Microsoft"]

sortByLength(["Leonardo", "Michelangelo", "Raphael", "Donatello"])
➞ ["Raphael", "Leonardo", "Donatello", "Michelangelo"]

sortByLength(["Turing", "Einstein", "Jung"])
➞ ["Jung", "Turing", "Einstein"]
_________



[Notes]

All test cases contain arrays with strings of different lengths, so you won't have to deal with multiple strings of the same length.
