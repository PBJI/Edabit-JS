####  Adding a Function to the String Prototype  ####

One of the fun parts of JavaScript is that you can extend all the standard types by extending their prototype. In this challenge, you need to give JavaScript Strings a swapCase() function, which will return a new string with all upper case characters swapped for lower case characters, and vice versa. Any non-alphabetic characters should be kept as they are.


[Examples]

_________
"Hello".swapCase() ➞ "hELLO"

"2 4 6 8 WHO DO WE APPRECIATE?".swapCase() ➞ "2 4 6 8 who do we appreciate?"

"aBcD".swapCase().swapCase() ➞ "aBcD"
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) swapCase() should not alter the original string.
*) Although you can add new functions to the standard data types, it's not generally a good idea in large projects!
