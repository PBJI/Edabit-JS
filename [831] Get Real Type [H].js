####  Get Real Type  ####

Create a function that takes a value as an argument and returns the type of this value. You should get the real type of a value (JavaScript typeof doesn't return the real object type of values and you need to fix that).


[Examples]

_________
realType(1) ➞ "number"

realType("a") ➞ "string"

realType(true) ➞ "boolean"

realType([]) ➞ "array"

realType(null) ➞ "null"
_________



[Notes]

N/A


[strings] [validation]
