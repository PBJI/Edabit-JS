/*Quadratic Equation

Create a function to find only the root value of x in any quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c. The function will take three arguments:
_________
*) a as the coefficient of x^2
*) b as the coefficient of x
*) c as the constant term
_________



[Examples]

_________
quadraticEquation(1, 2, -3) ➞ 1

quadraticEquation(2, -7, 3) ➞ 3

quadraticEquation(1, -12, -28) ➞ 14
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Quadratic equation is always guaranteed to have a root.
*) Check the Resources tab for more information on quadratic equations.
*) Calculate only the root that sums the square root of the discriminant, not the one that subtracts it.
*) Round the value / return only integer value.
