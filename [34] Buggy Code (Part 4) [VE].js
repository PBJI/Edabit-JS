/*Buggy Code (Part 4)

Emmy has written a function that returns a greeting to users. However, she's in love with Mubashir, and would like to greet him slightly differently. She added a special case in her function, but she made a mistake.
Can you help her?


[Examples]

_________
greeting("Matt") ➞ "Hello, Matt!"

greeting("Helen") ➞ "Hello, Helen!"

greeting("Mubashir") ➞ "Hello, my Love!"
_________



[Notes]

*) READ EVERY WORD CAREFULLY, CHARACTER BY CHARACTER!
