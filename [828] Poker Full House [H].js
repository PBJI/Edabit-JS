####  Poker Full House  ####

Create a function that determines whether or not a player is holding a Full House in their hand. A hand is represented as an array of 5 cards. A full house is defined as a pair of cards and a three-of-a-kind.
To illustrate: ["A", "A", "A", "K", "K"] would be a Full House, since the player holds 3 aces and 2 kings.


[Examples]

_________
isFullHouse(["A", "A", "A", "K", "K"]) ➞ true

isFullHouse(["3", "J", "J", "3", "3"]) ➞ true

isFullHouse(["10", "J", "10", "10", "10"]) ➞ false

isFullHouse(["7", "J", "3", "4", "2"]) ➞ false
