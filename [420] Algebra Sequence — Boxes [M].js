/*Algebra Sequence — Boxes

Create a function that takes a number (step) as an argument and returns the amount of boxes in that step of the sequence.

_________
*) Step 0: Start with 0
*) Step 1: Add 3
*) Step 2: Subtract 1
*) Repeat Step 1 & 2 ...
_________



[Examples]

_________
boxSeq(0) ➞ 0

boxSeq(1) ➞ 3

boxSeq(2) ➞ 2
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Step (the input) is always a positive integer (or zero).
*) For an odd step add 3, for an even step subtract 1.
