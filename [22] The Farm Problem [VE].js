/*The Farm Problem

In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
_________
*) chickens = 2 legs
*) cows = 4 legs
*) pigs = 4 legs
_________

The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.


[Examples]

_________
animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36

animals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22

animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Don't forget to return the result.
*) The order of animals passed is animals(chickens, cows, pigs).
*) Remember that the farmer wants to know the total number of legs and not the total number of animals.

You're almost there. Simply use the last expression to get x in terms of y or vice versa and use that to replace the corresponding variable in the lest-to-last expression.
