/*Folding a Piece of Paper

Create a function that returns the thickness (in meters) of a piece of paper after folding it n number of times. The paper starts off with a thickness of 0.5mm.


[Examples]

_________
numLayers(1) ➞ "0.001m"
// Paper folded once is 1mm (equal to 0.001m)

numLayers(4) ➞ "0.008m"
// Paper folded 4 times is 8mm (equal to 0.008m)

numLayers(21) ➞ "1048.576m"
// Paper folded 21 times is 1048576mm (equal to 1048.576m)
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) There are 1000mm in a single meter.
*) Don't round answers.

Suppose there is a paper having a thickness = 0.002 cm. Now we fold it into half, it's thickness doubles and becomes 0.004 cm. If we again fold it to half, it's thickne …
