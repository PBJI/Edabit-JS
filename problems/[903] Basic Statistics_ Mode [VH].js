####  Basic Statistics: Mode  ####

The mode of a group of numbers is the value (or values) that occur most often (values have to occur more than once). Given a sorted array of numbers, return an array of all modes in ascending order.


[Examples]

_________
mode([4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 9, 10]) ➞ [6]

mode([4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]) ➞ [5, 8, 9]

mode([1, 2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 7, 9]) ➞ [2, 6]
_________



[Notes]

In this challenge, all group of numbers will have at least one mode.
