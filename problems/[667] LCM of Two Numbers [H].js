/*LCM of Two Numbers

Write a function that returns the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers.


[Examples]

_________
lcm(9, 18) ➞ 18

lcm(8, 5) ➞ 40

lcm(17, 11) ➞ 187
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Both values will be positive.
*) The LCM is the smallest integer that is divisible by both numbers such that the remainder is zero.
