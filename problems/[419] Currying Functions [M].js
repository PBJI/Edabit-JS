/*Currying Functions

Mubashir was reading about currying functions. He needs your help to multiply an array of numbers using currying functions.
Create a function which takes a array arr of integers as an argument. This function must return another function, which takes a single integer as an argument and returns a new array.
The returned array should consist of each of the elements from the first array multiplied by the integer.


[Examples]

_________
multiply([1, 2, 3])(2) ➞ [2, 4, 6]

multiply([4, 6, 5])(10) ➞ [40, 60, 50]

multiply([1, 2, 3])(0) ➞ [0, 0, 0]
_________



[Notes]

Your function must be called multiply.
