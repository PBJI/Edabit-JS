/*End Corona!

Create a function that takes the number of daily average recovered cases recovers, daily average newCases, current activeCases, and returns the number of days it will take to reach zero cases.


[Examples]

_________
endCorona(4000, 2000, 77000) ➞ 39

endCorona(3000, 2000, 50699) ➞ 51

endCorona(30000, 25000, 390205) ➞ 79
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) The number of people who recover per day recovers will always be greater than daily newCases.
*) Be conservative and round up the number of days needed.
