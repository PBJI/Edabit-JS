/*A Redundant Function

Write a function redundant that takes in a string str and returns a function that returns str.


[Examples]

_________
const f1 = redundant("apple")
f1() ➞ "apple"

const f2 = redundant("pear")
f2() ➞ "pear"

const f3 = redundant("")
f3() ➞ ""
_________



[Notes]

Your function should return a function, not a string.
