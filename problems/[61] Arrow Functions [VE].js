/*Arrow Functions

In the Code tab you will find code that is missing a single character in order to pass the tests. However, your goal is to submit a function as minimalist as possible. Use the tips in the tips section below.
Write five adder functions:
_________
*) add2(x) should return 2 + x.
*) add3(x) should return 3 + x.
*) add5(x) should return 5 + x.
*) add7(x) should return 7 + x.
*) add11(x) should return 11 + x.
_________



[Tips]

Functions that consist only of a return can be written as a one-liner with an arrow function.
For example, the code:
_________
function areSame(a, b) {
    return a == b;
}
_________

Can be simplified to:
_________
areSame = (a, b) => a == b;
_________



[Bonus]

(a, b) => a == b is technically an anonymous function. However, it can be assigned to the identifier areSame and it can then be called using areSame().
