/*Flip the Boolean

Due to a programming concept known as truthiness, certain values can be evaluated to (i.e. take the place of) booleans. For example, 1 (or any number other than 0) is often equivalent to true, and 0 is often equivalent to false.
Create a function that returns the opposite of the given boolean, as a number.


[Examples]

_________
flipBool(true) ➞ 0

flipBool(false) ➞ 1

flipBool(1) ➞ 0

flipBool(0) ➞ 1
