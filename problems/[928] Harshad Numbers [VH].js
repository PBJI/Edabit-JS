####  Harshad Numbers  ####

Harshad/Niven numbers are positive numbers that are divisible by the sum of their digits. All single-digit numbers are Harshad numbers.
For example, 27 is a Harshad number as 2 + 7 = 9, and 9 is a divisor of 27.
Harshad numbers can occur in consecutive clusters. The numbers 1 through 10 are Harshad numbers. The numbers 132 and 133 are both Harshad numbers. The numbers 1014, 1015, 1016, 1017 are Harshad numbers.
Create a function that takes a number and returns an array of two elements. The first element is the length of the Harshad cluster of which the number is a part. The second is its order in the cluster.


[Examples]

_________
harshad(5) ➞ [10, 5]
// cluster = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
// The second element should be the layman order in the
// cluster, not the programming index.

harshad(133) ➞ [2, 2]
// cluster = [132, 133]

harshad(82) ➞ [0, 0]
// Not a Harshad number, so cluster length is 0, position is 0.
