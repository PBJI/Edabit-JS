/*Find the Highest Integer in the Array Using Recursion

Create a function that finds the highest integer in the array using recursion.


[Examples]

_________
findHighest([-1, 3, 5, 6, 99, 12, 2]) ➞ 99

findHighest([0, 12, 4, 87]) ➞ 87

findHighest([6,7,8]) ➞ 8
_________



[Notes]

Please use the recursion to solve this (not the max() method).
