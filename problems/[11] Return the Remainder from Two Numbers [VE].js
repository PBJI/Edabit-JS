/*Return the Remainder from Two Numbers

There is a single operator in JavaScript, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.


[Examples]

_________
remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1

remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3

remainder(-9, 45) ➞ -9

remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0
