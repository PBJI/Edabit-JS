/*I'd Like a New Shade of Blue, Please

I have a bucket containing an amount of navy blue paint and I'd like to paint as many walls as possible. Create a function that returns the number of complete walls that I can paint, before I need to head to the shops to buy more.
_________
*) n is the number of square meters I can paint.
*) w and h are the widths and heights of a single wall in meters.
_________



[Examples]

_________
howManyWalls(100, 4, 5) ➞ 5

howManyWalls(10, 15, 12) ➞ 0

howManyWalls(41, 3, 6) ➞ 2
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Don't count a wall if I don't manage to finish painting all of it before I run out of paint.
*) All walls will have the same dimensions.
*) All numbers will be positive integers.
