####  Matrix Transpose  ####

In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix A by producing another matrix, often denoted by A^T.
Create a function that takes a 2D array (matrix A) and returns a 2D array (matrix A^T).


[Examples]

_________
makeTranspose([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]) ➞ [
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 6, 9]
]

makeTranspose([
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
  [5, 6]
]) ➞ [
  [1, 3, 5],
  [2, 4, 6]
]

makeTranspose([
  ["a", "b"]
]) ➞ [
  ["a"],
  ["b"]
]
