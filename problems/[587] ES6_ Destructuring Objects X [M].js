  { name: "Jason", email: "jason@example.com" },
  { name: "Jeremy", email: "jeremy@example.com" },
  { name: "Jacob", email: "jacob@example.com" }
]

for(/* add code inside these parenthesis only */) {
      names.push(name)
}

[Notes]

_________
*) You only have to change the "for...of" loop parameters.
*) Ignore the const str assignment. This is only used for validation purposes.
*) Check the MDN docs to find out more about object destructuring in "for...of" loops (check the Resources tab).
