/*Array of Multiples

Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (num, length) and returns an array of multiples of num until the array length reaches length.


[Examples]

_________
arrayOfMultiples(7, 5) ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

arrayOfMultiples(12, 10) ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

arrayOfMultiples(17, 6) ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]
_________



[Notes]

Notice that num is also included in the returned array.
