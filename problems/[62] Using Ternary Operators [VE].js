/*Using Ternary Operators

The ternary operator (sometimes called Conditional Expressions) in JavaScript is an alternative to the if... else... statement.
It is written in the format:
_________
condition ? result_if_true : result_if_false
_________

Ternary operators are often more compact than multi-line if statements, and are useful for simple conditional tests.
For example:
_________
is_nice = true

// Using ternary operator.
state = is_nice ? "nice" : "not nice"

// Equivalent code using multi-line if statements.
if (is_nice)
  state = "nice"
else
  state = "not nice"
_________

Write a function that uses the ternary operator to return "yeah" if bool is true, and "nope" otherwise.


[Examples]

_________
yeah_nope(true) ➞ "yeah"

yeah_nope(false) ➞ "nope"
_________
