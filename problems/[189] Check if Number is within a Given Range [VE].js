/*Check if Number is within a Given Range

Given a number and an object with min and max properties, return true if the number lies within the given range (inclusive).


[Examples]

_________
isInRange(4, { min: 0, max: 5 }) ➞ true

isInRange(4, { min: 4, max: 5 }) ➞ true

isInRange(4, { min: 6, max: 10 }) ➞ false

isInRange(5, { min: 5, max: 5 }) ➞ true
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Numbers can be positive or negative, and they may not be integers.
*) You can assume min <= max is always true.
*) If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
*) If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab.
