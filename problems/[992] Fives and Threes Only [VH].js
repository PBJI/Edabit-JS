/*
####  Fives and Threes Only  ####

Starting with either 3 or 5 and given these operations:
_________
*) add 5
*) multiply by 3
_________

You should say if it is possible to reach the target number n.


[Examples]

_________
only5and3(14) ➞ true
// 14 = 3*3 + 5

only5and3(25) ➞ true
// 25 = 5+5+5+5+5

only5and3(7) ➞ false
// There exists no path to the target number 7
_________
