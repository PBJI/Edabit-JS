####  Does the Triangle Fit into the Triangular Hole?  ####

Create a function that takes the dimensions of two triangles (as arrays) and checks if the first triangle fits into the second one.


[Examples]

_________
doesTriangleFit([1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]) ➞ true

doesTriangleFit([1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]) ➞ true

doesTriangleFit([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 2]) ➞ false

doesTriangleFit([1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 6]) ➞ false
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Triangle fits if it has the same or smaller size as the hole.
*) The function should return false if the triangle with that dimensions is not possible.
