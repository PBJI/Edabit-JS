/*Measure the Depth of Emptiness

In this challenge you will receive an input of the form:
_________
[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]
_________

In other words, an array containing an array containing an array containing... an array containing nothing.
Your goal is to measure the depth of this array, where [] has a depth 1, [[]] has depth of 2, [[[]]] has depth 3, etc.


[Examples]

_________
measureDepth([]) ➞ 1

measureDepth([[]]) ➞ 2

measureDepth([[[]]]) ➞ 3

measureDepth([[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]) ➞ 11
_________
