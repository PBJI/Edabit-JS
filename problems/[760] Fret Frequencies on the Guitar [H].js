####  Fret Frequencies on the Guitar  ####

Create a function that takes a number of a guitar string and the number of the fret and returns the corresponding frequency of the note.
_________
*) Check the Resources Tab, for the correct frequencies per string.
*) The formula to calculate the frequency is: String Frequency * 2^(fret/12).
*) Round the frequency to the nearest hundreth.
*) For this challenge, we use "Standard Tuning".
_________

So, one fret = a semitone = a half step. From D to D♯ for instance.


[Examples]

_________
fretFreq(5, 12) ➞ 220

fretFreq(4, 6) ➞ 207.65

fretFreq(2, 23) ➞ 932.32
