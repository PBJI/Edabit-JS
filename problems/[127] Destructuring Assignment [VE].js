/*Destructuring Assignment

You can assign variables from arrays like this:
_________
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
first = arr[0]
second = arr[1]
third = arr[2]
other = arr.slice(3)

console.log(first) ➞ outputs 1
console.log(second) ➞ outputs 2
console.log(third) ➞ outputs 3
console.log(other) ➞ outputs [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
_________

However, this is long and tedious. Instead, we can use Object Destructuring to create all those variables in one line. Your task: Create variables first, second, third and other from the given array using Destructuring Assignment (check the Resources tab for some examples).


[Examples]

_________
first ➞ 1

second ➞ 2

third ➞ 3

other ➞ [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
_________

Your task is to unpack the arr writeyourcodehere into four variables, first, second, third, and other.


[Notes]

_________
*) Your solution should be just One Line of code.
*) If your solution is longer than one line of code, please check the Resources tab.
*) Another version of this challenge.
