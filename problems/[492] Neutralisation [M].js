/*Neutralisation

Given two strings comprised of + and -, return a new string which shows how the two strings interact in the following way:
_________
*) When positives and positives interact, they remain positive.
*) When negatives and negatives interact, they remain negative.
*) But when negatives and positives interact, they become neutral, and are shown as the number 0.
_________



[Worked Example]

_________
neutralise("+-+", "+--") ➞ "+-0"
// Compare the first characters of each string, then the next in turn.
// "+" against a "+" returns another "+".
// "-" against a "-" returns another "-".
// "+" against a "-" returns "0".
// Return the string of characters.
_________



[Examples]

_________
neutralise("--++--", "++--++") ➞ "000000"

neutralise("-+-+-+", "-+-+-+") ➞ "-+-+-+"

neutralise("-++-", "-+-+") ➞ "-+00"
_________



[Notes]

The two strings will be the same length.
