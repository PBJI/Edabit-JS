/*Which Function Returns the Larger Number?

Your function will be passed two functions, f and g, that don't take any parameters. Your function has to call them, and return a string which indicates which function returned the larger number.
_________
*) If f returns the larger number, return the string f.
*) If g returns the larger number, return the string g.
*) If the functions return the same number, return the string neither.
_________



[Examples]

_________
whichIsLarger(() => 5, () => 10) ➞ "g"

whichIsLarger(() => 25,  () => 25) ➞ "neither"

whichIsLarger(() => 505050, () => 5050) ➞ "f"

[Notes]

This exercise is designed as an introduction to higher order functions (functions which use other functions to do their work).
