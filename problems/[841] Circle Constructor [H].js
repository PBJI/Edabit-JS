####  Circle Constructor  ####

Create a Circle() constructor that takes the radius as a single argument and has the following properties and methods:

Instantiate this constructor with two circles:

For example, if I used the Circle constructor to instantiate a new instance called c0 with a radius of 1, I would have:


[Examples]

_________
c0.radius ➞ 1

c0.diameter ➞ 2

c0.getC() ➞ 6.28

c0.getA() ➞ 3.14
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Circumference: 2πr. Area: πr^2.
*) Use Math.PI for calculating circumference and area.
*) Round the perimeter and area results to the nearest hundredths place.
