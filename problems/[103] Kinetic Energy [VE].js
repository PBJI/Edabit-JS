/*Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy can be calculated with the following formula:

_________
*) m is mass in kg
*) v is velocity in m/s
*) KE is kinetic energy in J
_________

Return the Kinetic Energy in Joules, given the mass and velocity. For the purposes of this challenge, round answers to the nearest integer.


[Examples]

_________
kineticEnergy(60, 3) ➞ 270

kineticEnergy(45, 10) ➞ 2250

kineticEnergy(63.5, 7.35) ➞ 1715
_________



[Notes]

Expect only positive numbers for inputs.
