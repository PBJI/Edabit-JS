Given a number, return the total sum of that number multiplied by every number between 1 and 10.


[Examples]

_________
multiSum(1) ➞ 55
// 1 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 1 x 3 ...... 1 x 9 + 1 x 10 = 55

multiSum(6) ➞ 330
// 6 x 1 + 6 x 2 + 6 x 3 ...... 6 x 9 + 6 x 10 = 330

multiSum(10) ➞ 550

multiSum(8) ➞ 440

multiSum(2) ➞ 110
