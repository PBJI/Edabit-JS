[Notes]

_________
*) There will only be one common last vowel in each sentence.
*) If the word has one vowel, treat the vowel as the last one even if it is at the start of the word.
*) The question asks you to compile all of the last vowels of each word and returns the vowel in the list which appears most often.
*) y won't count as a vowel.
*) Return outputs in lowercase.
