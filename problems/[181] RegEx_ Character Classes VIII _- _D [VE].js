/*RegEx: Character Classes VIII ⁠- \D

You can think of character classes as characters with special meaning. They are recognized as special when you place the \ before the character.
Here are a list of the characters classes in JavaScript:
_________
., \cX, \d, \D, \f, \n, \r, \s, \S, \t, \v, \w, \W, \0, \xhh, \uhhhh, \uhhhhh, [\b]
_________

There is a hidden message in this string:
_________
const str = "242Edabit23 45can344 3be3 254324addictive!"
_________

Write the regular expression that reveals the hidden message. You have to remove all of the numbers to reveal the message. Use the character class \D in your expression.
