/*Check If the Brick Fits through the Hole

Write the function that takes three dimensions of a brick: height(a), width(b) and depth(c) and returns true if this brick can fit into a hole with the width(w) and height(h).


[Examples]

_________
doesBrickFit(1, 1, 1, 1, 1) ➞ true

doesBrickFit(1, 2, 1, 1, 1) ➞ true

doesBrickFit(1, 2, 2, 1, 1) ➞ false
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) You can turn the brick with any side towards the hole.
*) We assume that the brick fits if its sizes equal the ones of the hole (i.e. brick size should be less than or equal to the size of the hole, not strictly less).
*) You can't put a brick in at a non-orthogonal angle.
