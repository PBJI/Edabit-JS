/*Ones, Threes and Nines (Version #1)

Given an int, figure out how many ones, threes and nines you could fit into the number. You must create a class. You will make variables (class.ones, class.threes, class.nines) to do this.


[Examples]

_________
let n1 = new OnesThreesNines(5)
n1.nines ➞ 0

n1.ones ➞ 5

n1.threes ➞ 1

*) This was originally a Python problem over here.
*) See another Python version of this series.
*) I'd suggest using getters and setters for this, but you're welcome to use any method you choose!

Classes

Are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics …

Math.floor()

Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.

getter
