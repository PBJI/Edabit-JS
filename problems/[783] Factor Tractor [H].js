####  Factor Tractor  ####

Write a program to find all the prime factors of a given number. The program must return an array containing all the prime factors, sorted in ascending order. Remember that 1 is neither prime nor composite and should not be included in your output array.


[Examples]

_________
primeFactorize(25) ➞ [5, 5]

primeFactorize(19) ➞ [19]

primeFactorize(77) ➞ [7, 11]
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) Output array must be sorted in ascending order
*) The only positive integer which is neither prime nor composite is 1. Return an empty array if 1 is the input.
