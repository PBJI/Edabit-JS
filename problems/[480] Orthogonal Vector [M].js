/*Orthogonal Vector

Create a function that takes two vectors as arrays and checks if the two vectors are orthogonal or not. The return value is boolean. Two vectors a and b are orthogonal if their dot product is equal to zero.


[Examples]

_________
isOrthogonal([1, 2], [2, -1]) ➞ true

isOrthogonal([3, -1], [7, 5]) ➞ false

isOrthogonal([1, 2, 0], [2, -1, 10]) ➞ true
_________



[Notes]

_________
*) The two arrays will be of same length.
*) Check out the Resources tab.

Two vectors a and b are orthogonal if they are perpendicular, i.e., angle between them is 90°

Executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in single output value.
