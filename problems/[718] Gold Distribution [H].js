/*Gold Distribution

Mubashir and his friend Matt found some gold piles. They decided to follow simple rules to distribute the gold among them.
_________
*) Gold will be divided into n piles.
*) Each person will choose bigger gold pile either from far left or far right.
*) If the weight of both piles is equal then the person will choose left pile.
_________

Help them by creating a function that takes an array of gold piles gold and returns a two-element array with [Mubashir's Gold, Matt's Gold].


[Examples]

_________
goldDistribution([4, 2, 9, 5, 2, 7]) ➞ [14, 15]
// Mubashir will choose 7, Remaining piles = [4, 2, 9, 5, 2]
// Matt will choose 4, Remaining piles = [2, 9, 5, 2]
// Mubashir will choose 2, Remaining piles = [9, 5, 2]
// Matt will choose 9, Remaining piles = [5, 2]
// Mubashir will choose 5, Remaining piles = [2]
// Matt will choose 2
// Mubashir = 7+2+5 = 14, Matt = 4+9+2 = 15

goldDistribution([10, 1000, 2, 1]) ➞ [12, 1001]

goldDistribution([10, 9, 1, 2, 8, 4]) ➞ [16, 18]
_________



[Notes]

Mubashir gets to pick his gold first!
