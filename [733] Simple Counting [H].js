####  Simple Counting  ####

Mubashir needs your help to count a specific digit in an array.
You have to create a function that takes two integers n and d and makes an array of squares of all numbers from 0...<= n and returns the count of the digits d in the array.


[Examples]

_________
countDigits(10, 1) ➞ 4
// Squared array from 0 to 10 = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
// Digit 1 appeared 4 times in the array

countDigits(25, 2) ➞ 9

countDigits(10, 1) ➞ 4
_________



[Notes]

d will always be 0<=d<10.
